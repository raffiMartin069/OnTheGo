  **OnTheGo (OTG)** is a final semester project of BSIT 1st Year Second Semester 1-A-1 Section.
The project aims to address and enhance the ticketing system as well as the pick-up and
drop off of every passengers in Cebu City, Philippines. Though this project is only used
and presented in the University, this helps the team to enhance skill in coding and creating
real world projects.

  The landing page of the GUI contains a simple yet elegant design of which where would the personels
and customers would log in. Upon logging in, it would the enter a next page depending of who was
using the system. A separate page for customers and personells will be directed. 

  Customers can Reserve, Book and Cancel a transaction. They can customize the dates of when will
they want to travel. Payment on the otherhand is done through online specifically G-Cash QR Code.
Personells, on the other end, have access to informations about the Bus, Customers, Drivers and other
employees. Depending on the level of their status, some of the features are greyed out or not accessible.

Future updates might be made in order to mantain this project, until further notice, this project will remain 
as it is.
